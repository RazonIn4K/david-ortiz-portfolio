## Upwork Overview — AI Security & Prompt Defense

You’re shipping AI-powered workflows—Zapier, n8n, custom APIs—and investors or clients keep asking, “How safe is this?” I answer that question with hands-on audits tailored to automation stacks instead of generic compliance checklists. My background combines cloud security, database hardening, and prompt-injection research, so I know exactly where sensitive data leaks or malicious inputs sneak in.

**What I deliver:**
- Threat modeling for every automation hop (forms, webhooks, chatbots, and data stores).
- Prompt-injection and exfiltration testing against GPT-4o, OpenRouter, or Anthropic deployments.
- Access control review (tokens, environment variables, workspace permissions) plus rate-limiting and monitoring recommendations.
- Action plan prioritized by blast radius, complete with code snippets, policy updates, and logging queries.

We start with a 60-minute architecture session, then I spend 3–4 days in your stack. You’ll get:
1. **Findings Report:** plain-language summary + technical appendix.
2. **Mitigation Blueprint:** what to fix now, later, or automate.
3. **Implementation Support:** optional sprint to patch flows, add guardrails, and set up alerting via Slack/Email/SIEM.

If you’re preparing for enterprise deals, SOC 2, or simply want confidence before launching a chatbot, I can help you prove your AI systems are resilient and trustworthy.
