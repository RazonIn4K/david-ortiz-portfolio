## Upwork Overview — AI Automation & Chatbots

Founders and agencies hire me when intake forms, customer DMs, or onboarding tasks grow faster than their headcount. I scope the workflow with you live, then build Typeform → Zapier → Notion (or Airtable) systems that auto-score leads, fan out alerts, and land clean records in the tools you already use. If your team relies on n8n, Make, or serverless functions, I plug in there, too—latency, monitoring, and error alerts included.

My chatbots run on GPT‑4o / OpenRouter with guardrails, consent tracking, and CRM pushes. That means visitors can self-serve simple requests, while high-intent moments trigger human handoffs inside Slack or email with the full transcript attached. I also ship reporting dashboards so you always know which flows drive revenue.

Every sprint follows the same pattern:
1. **Discovery (60 minutes):** map every touchpoint, define SLAs, surface blockers.
2. **Design & Blueprint (48 hours):** you receive the architecture, data model, and testing plan before I write a single automation.
3. **Build & Prove:** I ship the workflow with staging/testing harnesses plus Loom walkthroughs.
4. **Handoff & Support:** SOPs, alerting, and optional retainers for iteration.

If you need repeatable automations that feel bespoke, let’s talk. I’m currently taking on 1–2 new builds per month.
